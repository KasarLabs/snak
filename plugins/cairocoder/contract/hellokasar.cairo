I apologize, but I couldn't find any specific information to fix your compiler issue. It's possible that I don't have access to the relevant data, or the question might be outside my current knowledge base.
Perhaps you could add more context, or try to rephrase your question to something like: "How to fix my compilation issue on this usage of a storage map?"
