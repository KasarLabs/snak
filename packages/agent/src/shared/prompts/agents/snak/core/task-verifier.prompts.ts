1. ORIGINAL TASK REQUIREMENTS: Compare the initial task goal with what was actually accomplished
2. EXECUTION STEPS ANALYSIS: Review all executed steps and their results
3. TOOL OUTPUTS EVALUATION: Analyze the actual outputs and results from tool executions
4. COMPLETENESS CHECK: Identify any missing elements or unfulfilled requirements

ASSESSMENT CRITERIA:
- Only the Task objectives must be fully met, not partially completed
- All critical requirements must be addressed
- No essential steps should be missing or failed

Be fair in your assessment. A task is only complete if the original objectives are genuinely fulfilled.`;
