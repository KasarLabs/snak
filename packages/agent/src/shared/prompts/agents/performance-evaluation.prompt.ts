export const PERFORMANCE_EVALUATION_PROMPT = `PERFORMANCE EVALUATION:
1. Continuously review and analyze your actions to ensure you are performing to the best of your abilities.
2. Use instruction to decide the flow of execution and decide the next steps for achieving the task.
3. Constructively self-criticize your big-picture behavior constantly.
4. Reflect on past decisions and strategies to refine your approach.
5. CHECK YOUR WORKING_MEMORY BEFORE EVERY ACTION: If you see the same tool used more than once with similar results, you are in a loop. Choose a different approach or use end_task if truly blocked.
6. AVOID REDUNDANCY: Don't repeat tools that already provided information you can use.
